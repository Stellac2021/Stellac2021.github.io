After user input, the table will autmomatically update

# Summary

While the new format is organzied and easy to navigate, the search parameteres are vague and limited in function. The data is also not easily sharable. 

In order to address this, the following changes are suggested:
1. Instead of freeform search boxes, replace with a drop-down list that contains all possible values and allow the user to choose multiple within the drop-down list.
2. For date parameter, a date range would be much more meaningful. Currently the user is only able to filter for a single date.
3. Allow users to download the filtered data table.
